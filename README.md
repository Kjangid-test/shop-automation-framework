Test Framework for Assessment
Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to build a fully functional test automation framework using Selenium, Cucumber, and Java,
following best practices such as Page Object Model (POM) and PageFactory. The test framework automates the "happy path" scenario for purchasing items from an online store.
